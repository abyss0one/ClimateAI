    "context.text1":"The climate and its behavior has become more unpredictable and worrying than ever. Alterations in the climate system are affecting every corner of the planet, and Catalonia is no exception. Aware of the importance of addressing this issue, we have developed this platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide accurate predictions of temperature, humidity and precipitation in the region.through graphs that reflect historical data, we will evidence the disturbing trend of increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall, with its consequent challenges, such as drought situations and other significant environmental. It is essential to understand that climate change is not just a distant or abstract issue, but has tangible impacts on our daily lives; from extreme weather events to changes in biodiversity and resource availability, we are witnessing the consequences of human action on the planet we inhabit. This is why we strongly believe in the power of information and knowledge as fundamental tools to promote change.",

    "context.text2":"Our mission goes beyond simply providing weather data. We will use this platform to raise awareness and sensitize everyone about the climate change issue that is manifesting itself in our own region. Our chatbot will be available to provide tips on how to be more sustainable on a daily basis, because every little action counts and can make a difference. We invite everyone to reflect on our daily actions and how they can impact the environment. Together, we can make more conscious decisions, adopt sustainable practices and promote positive changes to preserve the natural environment, not only for ourselves, but also for future generations. In this journey towards climate awareness and action, we hope that our platform will be a source of knowledge, inspiration and collaboration. Join us in this important mission to protect and conserve our planet by tackling climate change and building a more sustainable future for Catalonia and the whole world. Together we can make a difference!",

First, we collect and analyze a large amount of past climate data, spanning multiple years for each county in Catalonia. These data include temperature, humidity, and precipitation records, as well as other relevant climatic factors. We then apply machine learning algorithms and identify patterns, trends and relationships between climate variables. These models learn from past data and are able to perform extrapolations to predict future climate scenarios with high accuracy. In this way, our platform provides up-to-date and reliable forecasts that allow users to be prepared and aware for weather prediction in their respective geographic areas.",
